# React Firebase Authentication System

A secure and responsive authentication system built with **React.js**, **Firebase**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project demonstrates how to handle user registration, login, and protected routing in a modern web application.

## 🚀 Features

* **User Registration:** Create new accounts using Firebase's `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`.
* **User Login:** Secure authentication using `signInWithEmailAndPassword`.
* **Programmatic Navigation:** Uses React Router's `useNavigate` for automatic redirection after successful actions.
* **Form Validation:** Client-side checks for password matching and minimum length.
* **Persistent State:** Real-time monitoring of user authentication status.
* **Responsive UI:** Fully styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional look on all devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Authentication:** Firebase Auth
* **Routing:** React Router DOM

## 📝 Key Components Explained

### 1. Registration Logic

Checks if passwords match and satisfy the 6-character minimum requirement before calling Firebase to create a new user. Upon success, it redirects to the login page.

### 2. Login Logic

Authenticates credentials against Firebase. If valid, it redirects the user to the home/dashboard. It includes error handling to notify users of invalid credentials.

### 3. Navigation

Uses `<Link>` for declarative navigation and `useNavigate` for logic-based redirects, ensuring a Single Page Application (SPA) experience without page reloads.
